data Tree = Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree

FUNCTIONS
f1 := leafCount (Leaf _) = 1
f2 := leafCount (Node l r) = (leafCount l) + (leafCount r)

f3 := nodeCount (Leaf _) = 0
f4 := nodeCount (Node l r) = 1 + (nodeCount l) + (nodeCount r)

EQUATION
1 + nodeCount t = leafCount t

BASE CASE
{START : t = Leaf}
1 + nodeCount (Leaf)
{APPLY f3}
1 + 0
{BASIC ADDITION}
1
{REVERSE OF f1}
leafCount Leaf
{RESULT}
1 + nodeCount Leaf = leafCount Leaf

INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS
{Start : t = Node x x}
1 + nodeCount (Node x x)
{APPLY f4}
1 + 1 + (nodeCount x) + (nodeCount x)
{REARRANGE}
1 + (nodeCount x) + 1 + (nodeCount x)
{INDUCTIVE STEP}
leafCount x + leafCount x
{REVERSE OF f2}
leafCount (Node x x)
{RESULT}
1 + nodeCount (Node x x) = leafCount (Node x x)
{USE START-DEF}
1 + nodeCount t = leafCount t
