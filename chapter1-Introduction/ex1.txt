double :: Num a => a -> a is shown to be executed as such:
double x = x + x
I'm changing the double method to be, 
double x = x * 2. 

double (double 2) is exceuted in 2 ways:

double (2 * 2) //applying double 2
double 4 //applying 2 * 2
4 * 2 //applying double 4
8 //applying 4 * 2

double 2 * 2 //applying double(double (2)) where double(2) is an unknown var
4 * 2 //applying double(2) 
8 //applying 4 * 2
